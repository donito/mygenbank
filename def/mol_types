  This is the mol_types file for MyGenBank. It is the list copied from the most
  recent GenBank releas notes. You probably shouldn't edit this file unless
  GenBank comes out with a new mol_type and this document file lags the latest
  release. One special mol_type is 'AA', which I have added for nucleotide
  translations.
