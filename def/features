  This is the features file for MyGenBank. It is a subset of the GenBank
  Feature Key Names, which can be found in the release notes. Features that
  will be in MyGenBank start without a leading space. For example, the allele
  feature is not in MyGenBank, but CDS is. Note that single quotes are
  converted to underscores, (5'UTR is automatically changed to 5_UTR). You may
  edit this file as you wish by adding and removing leading spaces, but do not
  exceed 63 names.
